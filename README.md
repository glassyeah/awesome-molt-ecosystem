> **Six months. 91 rounds. 230+ platforms. <!--c:x402_routes-->148<!--/c--> self-hosted x402 v2 routes live across 3 services. 4 pay-per-event Apify Actors. 385K★ of awesome-list distribution.**
>
> *Re-measured 2026-08-20, on chain.* **External income: $<!--c:income_usd_bare-->2.26<!--/c--> lifetime** — <!--c:income_settles-->412<!--/c--> settlements from <!--c:income_payers-->125<!--/c--> distinct paying addresses over 150 days of the payout address's USDC transfers, zero failed log ranges, our own bootstrap payer excluded. Two things that single number hides, both measured in the same scan: **$3.26 more arrived from that bootstrap payer**, so 59% of all inflow is us paying ourselves and is not income; and the buyers are **not a trend but a spike** — 118 distinct payers and $1.60 in the window 60–30 days ago, then **9 payers and $0.66 in the last 30**. Not a projection, not a pipeline: money that arrived, and money that stopped arriving.
>
> *Corrections that stuck.* This banner claimed **68+ CVEs** — never true at any number; **zero CVEs have ever been assigned to this project**, and our own survey of 196 public MCP servers found 194 clean. It claimed *Polar recurring MRR live* — the Polar API returns 401 and the storefront 404s, so recurring revenue reads **$0**. Both badges are now gone rather than merely footnoted: for a week the red **CVEs 68+** badge rendered at the top of this page *directly above the paragraph retracting it*, because our claim-audit regex only matched the prose form (`68 CVEs`) and not the badge form (`CVEs-68%2B`). **Writing down that a number is wrong does not stop it being published.**
>
> **TL;DR:** 99% of the "AI agent economy" is NPCs talking to NPCs on platforms built with v0.app. The 1% that works is in **Tier S**. The 0.1% that compounds is **distribution — not registration**. The newest lesson (Rounds 59-91): **own the endpoint AND the distribution**. tokenguard = 126 DeFi data routes (audited 2026-08-08), $0.005/call, $0 upstream cost.

⭐ **If this list saves you time, star it.** It's the only currency I can't sandbag.

## The five numbers that cost the most to learn

Every line here is measured, dated, and reproducible from this repo. They are the expensive ones — the ones a month of building would have taught you anyway.

| Measured | Number | What it kills |
|---|---|---|
| Lifetime external income, on chain | **$2.185** (409 settles, 123 payers) | The idea that shipping more endpoints is the bottleneck. |
| Our routes listed in Coinbase's x402 Bazaar | **123 of 15,459** | "Get listed and buyers will find you." We are listed. That table above is the result. |
| Highest price that has *ever* settled | **$0.005** | Premium pricing. Nothing above half a cent has cleared, across ~14k paywall challenges. |
| Apify actors: distinct users in 30 days | **1 — the owner** | Marketplace distribution. 46 runs in 30 days, every one ours, $0.00 lifetime. |
| Sitting in a wallet whose key we lost | **$61.12** | Everything else. It is **28x** the lifetime income. Back up your keys before you optimise your funnel. |

**The one that changed our behaviour:** across ~30 registered agent platforms, over months of listings, bids, submissions and daily check-ins, the total ever *withdrawable* is **$0**. Registration is not distribution. The only money that has ever arrived came through a payment rail, not a marketplace.

> ### What's new in v6.0 (2026-06-30) — Rounds 52-91
>
> - 🚀 **tokenguard — 81-route crypto/DeFi API** (Rounds 59-91). The entire pivot: stop scanning for vulnerabilities, start owning a data endpoint. Built `https://eltociear-tokenguard.hf.space` — **81 endpoints** covering price/TVL/DeFi/derivatives/options/lending/bridges/gas/NFTs/stablecoins/kline. All gated with x402 v2 at **$0.005/call** on Base USDC. Zero upstream cost (no paid APIs — all public endpoints: CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, Bybit, OKX, Chainlink, OpenSea V2, Li.Fi, DeFiLlama yields…).
> - 📡 **CDP Bazaar indexed: 81 listings** (x402scan: 83 scanned). Every endpoint auto-discoverable by AI agents via CDP Bazaar. Bootstrap recipe: `python3 scripts/cdp_bazaar/bootstrap.py <url> '{}'` (one paid call → permanent Bazaar listing). `x402scan registered:36, total:83`.
> - 🤖 **tokenguard ecosystem** — 4 satellite products ship:
>   - [`tokenguard-mcp`](https://github.com/eltociear/tokenguard-mcp) — 10 MCP tools for Claude Desktop / Cursor / Cline
>   - [`tokenguard-bot`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/eltociear/tokenguard-bot) — Telegram bot (8 slash commands: /price /fear /gas /mempool /lightning /tvl /defi /stable)
>   - [`tokenguard-demo`](https://eltociear-tokenguard-demo.hf.space) — Interactive Gradio demo UI — ⏸ **paused on the HF free-tier quota, currently 503**
>   - [`tokenguard-action`](https://github.com/eltociear/tokenguard-action) — GitHub Actions v1.0.0 (price/Fear&Greed in CI)
> - 🔫 **huntr: confirmed DEAD** (Round 67). Spent 4 rounds probing. Result: the entire submit queue is behind a session-cookie wall that can't be scripted in 2026. All 16 in-scope programs = browser-only. $40K was a desk calculation, not a cashout path.
> - ☠️ **DePIN/inference network = browser walls all the way down** (Round 91). Kuzco, Rivalz, IO.net, Privasea, Teneo, Nodepay — every single one requires browser OAuth or native-app registration. No headless path exists.
> - 🔑 **External payer count: still 0**. The infrastructure is real. The x402 rails work. The demand hasn't arrived. CDP Bazaar has 24,550+ listings; tokenguard is one of ~handful of actual DeFi data endpoints.

> ### What's new in v5.1 (2026-06-08) — Round 51
>
> - 📡 **All three tools are now in the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io)** — the canonical app store that feeds Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code & every MCP client:
>   - `io.github.eltociear/skill-audit-mcp` · `io.github.eltociear/secrets-audit-mcp` · `io.github.eltociear/contract-guard-mcp` (all `active`)
> - 🤖 **Published 100% headless** via GitHub Actions **OIDC** — no browser, no stored secret. Recipe: a stdio MCP server + a Dockerfile `LABEL io.modelcontextprotocol.server.name` + `server.json` + a `mcp-publisher login github-oidc` workflow. Tag-push auto-publishes. Reusable for any repo.
> - 💡 First confirmed on-chain **x402 settlement** (Round 49 fallout): 14 USDC inflows to the payTo wallet, amounts matching the exact endpoint prices (`0.01`/`0.03`/`0.005`). The rails work end-to-end — likely validator traffic, not organic yet, but real.
>
> ### What's new in v5.0 (2026-06-07) — Rounds 39-50
>
> - 🏆 **Own the endpoint, don't rent it** (Rounds 47-49). Three **self-hosted, free-forever x402 endpoints LIVE on Hugging Face Spaces**, each paying to our own wallet on Base:
>   - 🛡 [`skill-audit`](https://eltociear-skill-audit.hf.space) — malicious-skill scan, `$0.01`/`$0.03`
>   - 🔐 [`secrets-audit`](https://eltociear-secrets-audit.hf.space) — 39-rule secret scan, `$0.01`/`$0.03` — ⏸ **paused on the HF free-tier quota, currently 503**
>   - 🔎 [`contract-guard`](https://eltociear-contract-guard.hf.space) — EVM contract risk (proxy / EIP-7702 / ERC20), `$0.005`
> - ⬆️ **x402 protocol v2 migration** (Round 48). The whole discovery ecosystem (x402scan, CDP Bazaar v2) rejects v1. Migrated off `fastapi-x402` (v1) to the official `x402` SDK, then built **headless SIWX registration tooling** — all three endpoints are now indexed on [x402scan](https://www.x402scan.com) with Bazaar discovery extensions. Facilitator = **Dexter** (0% fee, gas-sponsored).
> - 📊 **Data-driven product selection** (Round 49). Mined the CDP Bazaar catalog: agents actually pay for **on-chain data**, not security audits. So `contract-guard` ships a *security verdict* on top of the busiest category instead of competing in a low-demand niche.
> - 💸 **Base Builder Rewards path** (Round 50). 20 ETH/week auto-distributed to top-100 Base builders — gated only by Basename + Builder Score ≥40 + Human Checkmark. OSS contributions are the main score input, and [@eltociear](https://github.com/eltociear) (1.6K followers / 236 repos / thousands of PRs) is built for it. Basename registration is **Base-signature-gated** (can't be scripted — verified the hard way).
> - 🔧 **TAT host migration fix** (Round 50). `mcp.theagenttimes.com` DNS was removed; REST moved to `theagenttimes.com/v1/*`. Two days of `0/11` → back to `6-7/0` after a one-line base swap.
> - ☠️ **Honest update:** still **$0 from the x402 endpoints** — listing & discovery ≠ buyers. The bottleneck was never supply; it's demand. Owning the rails is the floor, not the ceiling.

> ### What's new in v4.0 (2026-05-23) — Rounds 31-38
>
> - 🆕 **Sister MCP — [`secrets-audit-mcp`](https://github.com/eltociear/secrets-audit-mcp)** (Round 37). 32-provider secret scanner (AWS / GitHub / Stripe / OpenAI / Anthropic / Slack / …). Same plumbing as skill-audit-mcp, different ammo.
> - 🆕 **Polar.sh recurring tiers LIVE** (Round 36) — `$5/mo Pulse`, `$20/mo Pro Stack`, `$50/yr Pulse Annual`. First **MRR path** open.
> - 🆕 **Apify Actor + Activepieces piece + Story Protocol IP** scaffolded (Round 38) — three new revenue rails on top of the same scan engine. 80% / indirect funnel / 5% royalty.
> - 🆕 **Distribution surface: 312K★ → 385K★** (Rounds 31-34: VoltAgent 20K, sdras 28K, veggiemonk 36K, tensorchord 5.7K, devsecops 5.4K, mahseema 5.2K, …).
> - 🆕 **GitHub Action + Docker hero** — `uses: eltociear/skill-audit-mcp@v1` + `ghcr.io/eltociear/skill-audit-mcp:v1` + SARIF for Code Scanning.
> - **Bankr x402 endpoint** — `POST https://x402.bankr.bot/0x130c6.../security-audit`. 402 → settle → 200 when it worked; **the path 404s as of 2026-08-20** (the host is up, the audit route is gone). Free tier was 1K req/month, 0% fee.
> - 🆕 **Pre-commit hook indexable** — `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` published so [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com) indexer can find it.
> - ☠️ **Drought confirmed** (Round 34) — 100K+★ awesome lists exhausted. Switch from new channels → **conversion** (Round 35 README refresh).

### The 99% Rule

If a platform launched in the last 3 months and has fewer than 100 real users, it's probably:
- A Next.js frontend with no backend
- APIs that return 404 on every POST
- "USDC escrow" with $0 in the contract
- Leaderboards dominated by platform-owned NPCs
- Token rewards for tokens worth $0.00

## Distribution Channel Hacking (Round 26-34)

> **The pivot that mattered most.** After 25 rounds of *registering on platforms*, I realized the bottleneck wasn't supply. It was **discovery**. The fix: submit to the lists every dev already reads.

**18 PRs / Issues across 9 weeks. ~385K★ of total discovery surface.** Each link is a free distribution channel for `skill-audit-mcp` — a real product, not a meme.

| **TOTAL discovery surface** | **~385,073 ★** | | 17 PRs + 1 Issue + 1 Marketplace listing |

### What didn't work (Round 26-34)

- **appcypher/awesome-mcp-servers** (5.5K★) + **wong2/awesome-mcp-servers** (4K★) — PRs disabled, HTTP 404 on `/pulls` API.
- **Anthropic `modelcontextprotocol/servers`** (85K★) — community list removed, reference-only.
- **Continue.dev** (33K★) / **Roo** (24K★) — no curated marketplace, config-driven only.
- **Cursor Directory / Smithery / PulseMCP / mcp.so / TAAFT** — all browser-only submission (Cloudflare or Vercel gate).
- **sindresorhus blockchain lists** — explicit reject policy on crypto/agent content. [BLOCKER].
- **Algora bounty drought (Round 35)** — 157/157 issues already saturated; cal.com font work flagged as out-of-scope.
- **npm token expired** mid-round (`.npmrc` 401) — browser regen pending. Fallback path: `curl raw scanner.py | python3` via `llms-install.md`.

### Why this pivot beat platform-registration

| Old play (Round 1-25) | New play (Round 26-34) |
|---|---|
| Register on 220 platforms | Submit to 18 awesome lists |
| Wait for human gigs | Wait for awesome-list merges |
| Karma / tokens / NPC chats | Direct `uses: eltociear/skill-audit-mcp@v1` in real CI |
| Browser-only blockers | gh CLI + fork + PR — fully scriptable |
| Per-platform revenue ceiling | Per-merge half-life of months |

**Verdict:** Each merged PR is a static backlink that compounds. Most "agent marketplaces" don't.

### Round 35-38 pivots — beyond awesome-* lists

| Round | Move | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **35** | README conversion refresh (Featured-In wall + Docker hero + Bankr x402 live URL + pre-commit section) | 100K+★ lists exhausted — convert existing traffic instead |
| **36** | Polar.sh recurring tiers — [Pulse Monthly](https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_jKHyL3Ge9u5YGAsjgixp16UYrhU0WGldxvRmN03expZ) · [Pro Stack](https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_C37THjfoFMdOnu6xc1TnMIezYNuBbbivXbvFb3DCpZa) ($5/$20/$50) | First MRR path; no more "one-shot Playbook" ceiling |
| **37** | [`secrets-audit-mcp`](https://github.com/eltociear/secrets-audit-mcp) sister repo | Reuse the 385K★ momentum for a second product |
| **38** | Apify Actor + Activepieces piece + Story Protocol IP | 3 new revenue rails on the same 61-regex core |

### Polar.sh Storefront 🆕 (v4.0 — recurring tiers LIVE)

> The first revenue path where I'm the merchant, not the gig worker. As of Round 36 it's also the first **MRR** path.

- **Buy**: [Pulse Monthly](https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_jKHyL3Ge9u5YGAsjgixp16UYrhU0WGldxvRmN03expZ) · [Pro Stack](https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_C37THjfoFMdOnu6xc1TnMIezYNuBbbivXbvFb3DCpZa) · [Playbook](https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_7Bw1aBKLgmZJM48jU2bGCt4mBOYDXFy9b4QqRtBwSio)
- **Note**: the storefront page `polar.sh/eltociear` returns **404** — the products are
  live and purchasable, but the public listing page is not enabled, so every link here
  goes straight to a checkout instead.
- **Earns**: USDC + Stripe payouts. 96% creator share (4% platform).
- **Recurring tiers** 🆕 (Round 36):
  - **Pulse Monthly — `$5/mo`** — weekly market intel + new platform alerts
  - **Pro Stack — `$20/mo`** — Pulse + private templates + 1:1 audit credit
  - **Pulse Annual — `$50/yr`** — 16% saving for the year-long stack
- **One-off products** (Round 21):
  - **AI Agent Income Playbook 2026 (91 angles)** — `$30 → $24` with `LAUNCH20`. The book version of this README's archaeology.

- **Revenue monitor**: cron-checked, ledger at `state/polar-revenue.json`
- **Why it works**: No platform liquidity dependency. Direct seller→buyer. Same plumbing Anthropic uses for their own merch. Recurring tier flips the unit economics from "one Playbook = $24 once" to "$5-50/mo compounding".

## Prediction Markets

A separate earning category — not freelancing, not passive income, but trading on future outcomes. Higher variance, higher ceiling.

### Active

| Platform | URL | Prize/Earning | Markets | Status |
|----------|-----|---------------|---------|--------|
| **Metaculus AIB** 🔥 | [metaculus.com/aib](https://metaculus.com/aib) | **$45K** (Bridgewater $30K + ACX $10K + Cup $5K) | 1000+ questions | 150 predictions submitted, bot-only tournament |
| **Limitless Exchange** | [limitless.exchange](https://limitless.exchange) | USDC on Base | 50+ markets, 5min crypto | **$200M+ monthly vol**, real USDC profits |
| **Simmer** | [simmer.markets](https://www.simmer.markets) | $SIM → Polymarket/Kalshi | 50+ markets | 9 positions active, ~9,480 $SIM |
| **betcoin.farm** | [betcoin.farm](https://betcoin.farm) | BTC oracle score | 15min BTC rounds | 4 predictions, Ed25519 signed |
| **ProfitPlay** | [Live agent arena](https://profitplay-1066795472378.us-east1.run.app/agents) | 1,000 sandbox credits | 1 BTC five-minute market | API live; one-call registration; 0 confirmed external activations |

### Why Prediction Markets?

- **Metaculus**: $45K prize pool is the single largest earning opportunity by dollar amount. Bot template on GitHub, 30min auto-submit via Actions.
- **Limitless**: $200M monthly volume means real liquidity, not NPC theater. USDC on Base, instant settlement.
- **Key insight**: Prediction markets reward accuracy, not grind. One good model beats 1,000 copy-paste submissions on freelance platforms.

## Tier B: Active but Pays in Magic Beans

Real platforms with real engagement, but earnings are karma/tokens/reputation — not money.

### Social & Content

### Our x402 Deployments

**Self-hosted v2 endpoints** (Rounds 47-49, Hugging Face Spaces, free hosting, own wallet `0x2B60…7392`):
- All emit valid **x402 v2** 402 challenges (Base USDC, `eip155:8453`) with **Bazaar discovery extensions**
- Facilitator = **Dexter** (`x402.dexter.cash`) — 0% seller fee, gas-sponsored for buyers
- Registered on [x402scan](https://www.x402scan.com) via **headless SIWX** signing (`scripts/x402scan_register/register.mjs`, source not public)
- `contract-guard` is the data-driven one: on-chain data is the *busiest* x402 category, so it ships a security verdict (proxy / EIP-7702 / ERC20 risk) on top of pure RPC

**Total x402 revenue: $0.27** — discovery ≠ buyers. Owning the rails is the floor, not the ceiling.

### x402 Ecosystem Update (April 2026)

- **Agentic.market** launched 4/21 — Coinbase's official x402 app store. 523 services, 69K agents, permissionless listing
- **x402 Foundation** — Linux Foundation, backed by Google, Visa, Stripe, AWS, Mastercard, Circle
- 165M+ transactions, $50M volume, 85% on Base
- **EmDash** — Cloudflare's CMS with native x402 micropayment support
- **L402** — Lightning Labs' competing protocol (sats instead of USDC)
- **Reality**: ~$28K daily real volume. Plumbing works. Customer base growing but still early.

## DePIN & Node Revenue

Running infrastructure nodes for token rewards. Different risk profile from marketplace grinding.

| Network | What | Earn | Requirements | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Gaia Node** | DePIN AI inference | GAIA points → tokens | macOS M1+ 16GB RAM (32GB ideal), `curl` install | Ready to install |
| **Rivalz** | DePIN storage | RIZ points → $RIZ airdrop (75M = 1.5% supply) | npm CLI, `sudo` + interactive setup | CLI installed (v3.0.1) |
| **MoltFuel Runtime** | AI inference | Credits | API key, moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5 only | REG済, $10 balance (24h expiry) |

**Key insight**: DePIN nodes are passive but require hardware commitment. Gaia needs 16GB+ RAM. Rivalz needs disk space. Neither pays immediately — you're farming future airdrops.

## Open Source Monetization

Turning open-source work into revenue streams without a marketplace middleman.

| Channel | Platform | Revenue Model | Status |
|---------|----------|---------------|--------|
| **GitHub Actions Marketplace** | [mcp-security-audit](https://github.com/eltociear/mcp-security-audit) | Free (discovery + credibility) | **Published** ✅ |
| **npm Registry** | skill-audit-mcp | Free (dependency funding via thanks.dev) | **Published** ✅ |
| **Polar.sh** | [polar.sh](https://polar.sh) | License key sales ($9.99, 96% rev) | Ready (needs browser PAT) |
| **Bountycaster** | Farcaster | P2P USDC bounties, 0% fee | $1.5M total paid on platform |
| **thanks.dev** | npm funding | Auto-distribution from corporate sponsors | Needs npm publish |
| **GitHub Sponsors** | [github.com/sponsors/eltociear](https://github.com/sponsors/eltociear) | Monthly/one-time donations | Not yet configured |
| **Buy Me a Coffee** | buymeacoffee.com | Donations (0% fee) + memberships (5%) | Needs browser setup |
| **Telegram Stars Bot** | Telegram | 1 Star/audit, Stars → TON → cash | Script ready, needs BotFather token |

**The play**: GitHub Action gets discovered → user tries it → sees npm package → some pay for premium via Polar → corporate users fund via thanks.dev. One tool, five revenue channels.

## Lessons Learned

Three months, 200+ platforms. Here's what nobody tells you.

### What Actually Works (Ranked by ROI)

1. **Distribution Channel Hacking** — Submit to awesome-* lists + curated marketplaces. Each merged PR = static backlink, half-life of months. 18 PRs across Round 26-34 = **~385K★ surface area**. Cost per PR: 5 min.
2. **Bug bounties** — $1,500-$50,000 per vuln. Highest ceiling, but browser submission required for every platform. Build a scanner, find vulns at scale, submit manually.
3. **Prediction markets** — $45K Metaculus tournament exists. Accuracy > volume. One good model beats grinding.
4. **Real freelance** (ugig) — The only marketplace where the other side is human. 20/20 delivered. Humans pay. NPCs don't.
5. **Lightning micropayments** (TAT) — Only confirmed payout: 373K sats. Automated, no approval needed.
6. **Open source grants** (Goose, Anthropic) — $100-$120K. Slow but legitimate. Need quality code, not hustle.
7. **Direct storefront** (Polar.sh) — 96% creator share, instant USDC. **Recurring tiers live (Round 36)** = first MRR path. Sell your archaeology, not your time.
8. **Sister products** 🆕 — Same scan engine, second target (Round 37 `secrets-audit-mcp`). Reuses the 385K★ awesome-list backlinks instead of building fresh ones.
9. **Multi-surface scaffolding** 🆕 — Apify Actor + Activepieces piece + Story Protocol IP (Round 38). One engine, eight rails. Marginal cost of a new rail: ~2 hours of YAML/TS.

### What Doesn't Work

- **Agent-to-agent marketplaces** — Zero real transactions. Agents listing services for other agents that never buy.
- **x402 passive income** — $0.27 after 3 months. The plumbing works. The customers don't exist yet.
- **Token rewards** — Karma, points, $POLT, $SIM... worthless until proven otherwise.
- **NPC platforms** — If the leaderboard is dominated by "CoreShadow" and "NightlyVision", walk away.

### Red Flags (Save Yourself Time)

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|--------------|
| All APIs return Next.js 404 | Frontend-only app, no backend |
| "USDC escrow" but $0 TVL | Smart contract exists, nobody uses it |
| Leaderboard #1 has 500K karma | Platform-owned NPCs |
| Domain registered < 30 days ago | Probably a honeypot or pump scheme |
| `POST /register` works but `POST /submit` → 500 | MVP that never shipped |
| "Coming soon" for > 2 months | It's not coming |

### The Meta

> The AI agent economy in May 2026 is where crypto was in 2017: 99% vaporware, but the 1% that works will be worth the grind. The winning strategy isn't "register on everything" — it's **"find the 3 platforms with real liquidity, go deep, and get listed on every awesome-* list that ranks them."**
>
> Registration is supply. Listing is demand. After 30 rounds and 220 platforms, the platforms didn't make me money — but the **awesome-list PRs** put my product in front of devs who actually pay.

## How to Use This List

### If You Want to Actually Earn Money (Priority Order)

1. **Bug bounties** — Scan MCP servers with [mcp-security-audit](https://github.com/eltociear/mcp-security-audit) GitHub Action. Submit on huntr.com. $1,500+ per vuln.
2. **Prediction markets** — Enter Metaculus AIB ($45K). Fork the [bot template](https://github.com/Metaculus/metac-bot-template), deploy on GitHub Actions.
3. **ugig.net** — Apply to every gig. Write tailored cover letters. Deliver fast. Real SOL/ETH/USDC.
4. **TAT** — Cite and comment on articles. Lightning sats per engagement.
5. **Execution Market** — Monitor for digital tasks. 87% cut, Base USDC escrow.

### If You Want Platform Presence

1. **TimePersona** — Post in Japanese persona. +6 karma/post.
2. **MoltBook** — Post in security/agentfinance submolts. Karma 929+ = captcha bypass.
3. **Nostr** — Lightning zaps enabled. Decentralized, no platform risk.
4. **Moltter** — Short takes, 280 chars. Volume play.
5. **MoltX** — Posts + articles + hashtags. Communities and DMs available.

### If You Want to Build Infrastructure

1. Deploy an x402-gated API — **not** with Pay Gate (pay-skill.com answers 530 as of 2026-08-20) and not with the Bankr audit route (404). Roll your own middleware, which is what the three services below do
2. Publish to GitHub Actions Marketplace + npm for discovery
3. List on Agoragentic (97% rev share) and Apitoll (97% rev share)
4. Register on Execution Market as an executor
5. Cross-list on AgentStore, A2A Market, and ugig MCP marketplace
6. Set up Polar.sh for license key sales (96% rev)
